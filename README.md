# 🎢 Bezier Roller Coaster with 2D Animator Path

This C# project was designed for the **Computer Graphics** course using **Windows Forms** and **System.Drawing** to demonstrate curve-generation and animation techniques.

## 🧩 Project Description

**Bezier Roller Coaster with 2D Animator Path** is a 2D interactive graphics project that allows users to build and animate motion paths using fundamental curve algorithms — **DDA Line Drawing**, **Circle Sampling**, and **Bézier Curves**.

Bezier Roller Coaster with 2D Animator Path is a 2D graphics project that demonstrates curve-based path generation and animation using DDA lines, circle sampling, and Bézier curves.
Users can build smooth connected tracks and animate a ball and sprite moving along them while the background scrolls dynamically, visualizing parametric motion and curve interpolation in real time.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** Windows Forms (.NET)  
- **Core Algorithms:**  
  - Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)  
  - Circle Sampling Algorithm  
  - Bézier Curve Interpolation (Bernstein Form)  
- **Additional Features:**  
  - Dynamic Camera Scrolling

## 🕹️ How To Use

- **L** → Add a line segment (DDA)  
- **C** → Add a circular arc (with tangent connections)  
- **B** → Add a Bézier curve segment  
- **↑ / ↓** → Modify the last segment (length, radius, or control-point height)  
- **SPACE** → Start the animation (object moves along the constructed path)  
- **S** → Increase animation speed

## 🎮 Game Environment

The system displays a 2D **neon city background** where the user constructs path segments sequentially.  
Once animated, a **ball and character** traverse the generated curve, mimicking the motion of a roller coaster while demonstrating curve continuity and motion sampling.
